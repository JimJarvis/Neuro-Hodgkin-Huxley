# Neuro-Hodgkin-Huxley
Computational neuroscience: Hodgkin-Huxley neural spiking model

- Numerically model the system of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron differential equations
  - [Project description](doc/hw1.pdf)
  - [BMEB W4020 class](http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu/courses/BMEB_W4020/2015)
  - [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model)
- Visualize relations between:
  - Time
  - External current (different type, amplitude, frequency)
  - Firing frequency
  - Potassium (K)/sodium (Na) capacitive current
  - K/Na standalone voltage
  - K/Na internal state
  - K/Na memconductance
  - Charge (integral of current)
  - Flux (integral of voltage)
- Experiment and explore:
  - Spike firing conditions
  - Effect of bandlimited white noise on firing frequency
  - Nonlinear oscillation patterns
  - Differences between K and Na channels
